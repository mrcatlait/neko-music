# Generate Commit Message

## Description

Generate a commit message that:

1. Summarizes the main purpose of the changes
2. Follows best practices for commit message formatting
3. Includes any relevant details about the implementation or impact
4. Mentions any new files added or significant refactoring

Suggested commit message format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

## Commit Types

- feat: new feature
- fix: bug fix
- docs: documentation updates
- style: code formatting (changes that don't affect code execution)
- refactor: refactoring (code changes that are neither new features nor bug fixes)
- test: adding tests
- chore: changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

## Commit Message Standards

- Subject Line Limit: No more than 72 characters
- Use Imperative Mood: Start with verbs like "fix", "add", "update"
- Clear Subject: Clearly describe the main changes in this commit
- Detailed Body: Provide detailed change description when necessary
